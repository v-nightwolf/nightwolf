<pre><code>  1. Explain the below error:

            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
            find: page allocation failure. order:5, mode:0x0
            Pid: 22938, comm: find Not tainted 2.6.32-279.el6.i686 #1
            Call Trace:
            [&lt;c04f22bc&gt;] ? __alloc_pages_nodemask+0x6bc/0x870
            [&lt;c051f1bc&gt;] ? cache_alloc_refill+0x2bc/0x510

            [&lt;f7fdb2f0&gt;] ? rpc_wait_bit_killable+0x0/0x80 [sunrpc] 
            -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Hint =&gt;
        Above error is kernel dump due to kmalloc buffer exhaustion. The system is out of memory and cannot 
        satisfy the allocation request at all. This is more likely to happen on swap-less systems that are 
        unable to purge application pages to free up memory.
        The system may have sufficient free pages in total but not enough that are physically contiguous to 
        satisfy the allocation request. This is referred to as memory fragmentation.

          - The phrase "page allocation failure" - this defines the error that should be used for error search.
          - The process name "find" - often page allocation failures are related to code that gets executed by
            specific threads, try searching KCS with and without this term. If the allocation request was
            performed by an interrupt service routine then the process name will be irrelevant.
          - The order of the allocation "order:5" and mode "mode:0x0" can often be the same for every instance
            of a particular problem, try searching KCS with and without these terms.
          - The function requesting the memory allocation "rpc_malloc()" is likely to be the same for every 
            instance of this particular problem so include that in the KCS search.
          - Do not search for the CPU number, the process id or function offsets since they will change and
            may prevent finding a match.

            For more details https://access.redhat.com/articles/1360023

  2. What is order:5, mode:0x0 in above output.

  3. Difference between kernel panic due to Memory crunch and page allocation failure.

  4. Difference between VMalloc and KMalloc
     Hint =&gt;
        The kmalloc() &amp; vmalloc() functions are a simple interface for obtaining kernel memory in byte-sized
        chunks.

         - The kmalloc() function guarantees that the pages are physically contiguous (and virtually contiguous).
         - The vmalloc() function works in a similar fashion to kmalloc(), except it allocates memory that is 
           only virtually contiguous and not necessarily physically contiguous.

  32. What is paging and swapping in Linux? Please explain Page fault ?

  33. What is difference between cache and buffer?

  34. Explain what is NUMA. You may know this as "Node Interleaving”. Give an example where NUMA is beneficial, 
      and another where it's detrimental.
      Hints =&gt;
         a). NUMA: Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a design where the memory is split into groups by CPU,
             making the memory access faster for each CPU to their memory group.
         b). Beneficial: Multiple processes with smaller memory footprints. Good for applications that fork
             processes, like Apache.
             Detrimental: Monolithic, memory-heavy, single processes. May be threaded, example MySQL, Redis,
             Java-everything, Memcached.

         Follow-Up Q. - what if there's only a single physical proc.

  35. Customer complains that their CPUs aren't running as fast as they're rated. How would you Troubleshoot ?
      Hints =&gt; 
         a). Could be heat damage - check /proc/cpuinfo for "cpu MHz".
         b). Could be the wrong CPUs installed. Check the CPU specs in /proc/cpuinfo. OR dmidecode.
         c). Change system profile to MaximumPerformance with omconfig, then reboot.

  36. Can we check System logs on Hardware layer from OS ?How ?
      Hints =&gt;
         a). Yes, in dmesg logs or kern.log
         b). By using respective Hardware CLI commands.
         c). Specific answers
                  hpasmcli -s "show iml"  ==&gt; For HP servers
                  omreport system [alertlog | esmlog]   ==&gt; For Dell Servers

  37. What can be done to improve the performance of an I/O-heavy system?
      Hints =&gt;
         a). Check RAID Level, if server using any.
         b). Partition aligned, i.e. starting a partition on sector 2048.
         c). Mount Options like: noatime - (covers norelatime/nodiratime) Can be enabled only via fstab.
         d). RAID Controller settings - read/write policy, e.g. write-through(good to ensure data has been 
             changed on disk. write-back(relys on cache, battery).
         e). nobarrier - depends on whether or not the PERC Controller is making use of a battery or not.
         f). Adjust the filesystem journaling method - the default mount option is in the middle, data=ordered. 
             This indicates the data is written out to the filesystem before the metadata in the journal is
             updated. The filesystem can be mounted with data=writeback which allows data to be written to
             the journal and disk at the same time, with the risk of some data possibly being written to the
             disk after the metadata that cannot be recovered after a crash. Additionally, the journal can be
             placed on an external device with another mount option, allowing separation of the writes to 
             increase throughput performance for each write operation.

         g). discard - For SSDs. Also called fs TRIM. Extends life and improves performance of SSD drives. 
             TRIM enables the controller to cache the expected SSD write cycles to collapse them into a "do only
             only" mechanism to prevent burning out the SSD cells, which can only be written to once with voltage.
             Note: For LVM, set issue_discards=1 in lvm.conf.
             Note: On Dell, TRIM/discard is only available on RAID controllers &gt;= PERC H710

         h). For SSD, you don't want controller caching for performance reasons. By default HPs turn caching off.
             Dell: Cut-through IO (CTIO) is an IO accelerator for SSD arrays that boosts the throughput of 
             devices connected to the PERC Controller. It is enabled through disabling the write-back cache 
             (enable writethrough cache) and disabling Read Ahead.
             HP: On servers with SSD drives, write caching appears to be disabled by default for performance 
                 reasons (there is no need for write caching on SSD drives which are fast enough). Writes to SSD
                 drives will not be acknowledged until the data is actually written to disk:

         i). On HP, HP SSD Smart Path - this is enabled by default by the RAID creation process in the HP RAID
             controller itself, and can be checked with the standard commands using hpssacli to view controller
             details and RAID logical device details. The theory is this special method of SSD writing replaces
             traditional caching techniques with a special HP invented method for improving SSD performance and 
             longevity.

         j). Disk IO Scheduler
             deadline (recommended for DBs)
             noop (recommended for VMs)


  38. Why would I choose to use RAID-5 instead of RAID-10? Or vice versa?
      Hints =&gt; 
         RAID-5:
             Pro: Space efficiency - you only sacrifice 1x HDD to redundancy.
             Pro: Possible with a minimum of 3x drives, as opposed to RAID-10's minimum-4.
             Con: Slow writes. Note: Reads are still quick though, so you'd be fine on a read-heavy application.
             Con: If two drives fail, you lose everything.

         RAID-10:
             Pro: Great performance with both reads and writes. Good for write-heavy applications.
             Pro: Less risk of a catastrophic failure, since more than 1 drive can fail safely (Note: Depends which
                  drives).
             Con: Too much wastage of Space. Only 50% capacity is uasable.


  39. How snapshots work ? Can you please explain. In terms of VMWare or LVM(in case someone asks).
      Hints =&gt; 
         As soon as you create a snapshot, LVM creates a pool of blocks. This pool also contains a full copy of
         the LVM metadata of the volume. When writes happen to the main volume such as updating an inode, the
         block being overwritten is copied to this new pool and the new block is written to the main volume. 
         This is the 'copy-on-write'. Because of this, the more data that gets changed between when a snapshot
         was taken and the current state of the main volume, the more space will get consumed by that snapshot
         pool. When you mount the snapshot, the meta-data written when the snapshot was taken allows the mapping 
         of snapshot pool blocks over changed blocks in the volume (or higher level snapshot). This way when an
         access comes for a specific block, LVM knows which block access. As far as the filesystem on that volume
         is concerned, there are no snapshots.

  40. In which scenario we need to use vgcfgrestore and vgcfgbackup commands ? When /etc/lvm/archive contents are 
      written (when does backup happen ?)
      Hints =&gt;
         a). To restore VG configuration.
         b). Backup is taken whenever we make change to LVM (create/remove LV/VG) and we can use it to restore to
             the prior state.

  41. What is default signal sent by KILL command ?
      Hint =&gt;
         a). singnal 15 (SIGTERM) is sent by default if you do not specify the signal type.

  42. What is deadlock ? How to identify if process is in deadlock in Linux/Unix ?
