    Correct Answer:
    Section: [none] Explanation
    Explanation/Reference:
    Explanation:
    Use two fault domains.
    2 or 3 is max value, depending on which region you are in.
    Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount
    Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability planning
    when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that fewer of their nodes
    in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

<p>QUESTION 20</p>
<pre><code>    You need to define a custom domain name for Azure AD to support the planned infrastructure. Which domain
    name should you use?
    A. ad.humongousinsurance.com
    B. humingousinsurance.onmicrosoft.com
    C. humongousinsurance.com
    D. humongousinsurance.local
    Correct Answer: C Section: [none] Explanation
    Explanation/Reference:
    Explanation:
    Every Azure AD directory comes with an initial domain name in the form of domainname.onmicrosoft.com. The
    initial domain name cannot be changed or deleted, but you can add your corporate domain name to Azure
    AD as well. For example, your organization probably has other domain names used to do business and users
    who sign in using your corporate domain name. Adding custom domain names to Azure AD allows you to assign
    user names in the directory that are familiar to your users, such as ‘alice@contoso.com.’ instead of
    'alice@domain name.onmicrosoft.com'.
    Scenario:
    Network Infrastructure: Each office has a local data center that contains all the servers for that
    office. Each office has a dedicated connection to the Internet.
    Humongous Insurance has a single-domain Active Directory forest named humongousinsurance.com
    Planned Azure AD Infrastructure: The on-premises Active Directory domain will be synchronized to Azure AD.

    You have an on-premises file server named Server1 that runs Windows Server 2016. You have an Azure
    subscription that contains an Azure file share.
    You deploy an Azure File Sync Storage Sync Service, and you create a sync group. You need to synchronize
    files from Server1 to Azure.
    Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list
    of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.
    Select and Place:
    Correct Answer:
    Section: [none] Explanation
    Explanation/Reference:
    Explanation:
    Step 1: Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1
    The Azure File Sync agent is a downloadable package that enables Windows Server to be synced with an Azure
    file share
    Step 2: Register Server1.
    Register Windows Server with Storage Sync Service
    Registering your Windows Server with a Storage Sync Service establishes a trust relationship between your
    server (or cluster) and the Storage Sync Service.
    Step 3: Add a server endpoint
    Create a sync group and a cloud endpoint.
    A sync group defines the sync topology for a set of files. Endpoints within a sync group are kept in sync
    with each other. A sync group must contain one cloud endpoint, which represents an Azure file share and
    one or more server endpoints. A server endpoint represents a path on registered server.

<p>QUESTION 50</p>
<pre><code>    SIMULATION
    Please wait while the virtual machine loads. Once loaded, you may proceed to the lab section. This may
    take a few minutes, and the wait time will not be deducted from your overall test time.
    When the Next button is available, click it to access the lab section. In this section, you will perform
    a set of tasks in a live environment. While most functionality will be available to you as it would be
    in a live environment, some functionality (e.g, copy and paste, ability to navigate to external websites)
    will not be possible by design.
    Scoring is based on the outcome of performing the tasks stated in the lab. In other words, it doesn’t
    matter how you accomplish the task, if you successfully perform it, you will earn credit for that task.
    Labs are not timed separately, and this exam may have more than one lab that you must complete. You can
    use as much time as you would like to complete each lab. But, you should manage your time appropriately
    to ensure that you are able to complete the lab(s) and all other sections of the exam in the time provided.
    Please note that once you submit your work by clicking the Next button within a lab, you will NOT be able
    to return to the lab.
    You may now click next to proceed to the lab.

    Task 4
    You need to deploy an Azure virtual machine named VM1004a based on an Ubuntu Server image, and then
    configure VM1004a to meet the following requirements:
    The virtual machine must contain data disks that can store at least 15 TB of data. The data disks must be
    able to provide at least 2.000 IOPS.
    Storage costs must be minimized.
    What should you do from the Azure portal?
    Correct Answer: See solution below.
    Section: [none] Explanation
    Explanation/Reference:
    Explanation:
    Step 1: Open the Azure portal.
    Step 2: On the left menu, select All resources. You can sort the resources by Type to easily find your images.
    Step 3: Select the image you want to use from the list. The image Overview page opens. Step 4: Select
    Create VM from the menu.
    Step 5: Enter the virtual machine information.
    Select VM1004a as the name for the first Virtual machine.
    The user name and password entered here will be used to log in to the virtual machine. When complete,
    select OK. You can create the new VM in an existing resource group, or choose Create new to create a new
    resource group to store the VM.
    Step 6: Select a size for the VM. To see more sizes, select View all or change the Supported disk type
    filter. To support 15 TB of data you would need a Premium disk.
    Step 7: Under Settings, make changes as necessary and select OK.
    Step 8: On the summary page, you should see your image name listed as a Private image. Select Ok to start
    the virtual machine deployment.
