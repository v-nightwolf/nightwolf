<p>A team of developers would like to have a standard work environment in Compute Engine.
You would like to be able to create multiple instances with identical configurations. The
configurations should be easy to change. What feature of Compute Engine would you use to specify the configuration?</p>
<pre><code>a). snapshot
b). managed instance groups
c). instance template
d). unmanaged instance groups

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Instance templates specify the configuration of virtual machines and managed instance groups.
    Unmanaged instance groups may be heterogeneous and do not use instance templates. Snapshots
    are copies of disks at a point in time. They are useful for backups and copying disks but are not
    used for specifying configurations.

<p>An IoT startup is uploading 2 TB of historical data to Cloud Storage. The data is in files
with one file per day per sensor. There are thousands of files. The file names are the date
followed by sensor ID, such as 20210101sensorABCD for a file with data from a sensor
called ABCD on January 1, 2021. The loads are not proceeding as quickly as expected.
What might be the cause of the slower than expected upload?</p>
<pre><code>a). The files are in gzip format instead of Avro format.
b). The file names use the date as the first part of the filename so they may be creating hotspots 
    when writing data to Cloud Storage.
c). The files are in CSV instead of Avro format.
d). The data in files is being encrypted before being persisted to storage.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Files are written to servers within the Cloud Storage system based on filenames. Lexically close
    file names are written to the same server. This can lead to hotspotting, which is an imbalance in
    workload that has a small number of servers doing more work than other servers. Data is always
    encrypted before being persisted to storage so there should be no unexpected overhead for
    encrypting data. The size of the file not the format is the primary determiner of how long a file
    will take to load. tspots in which a few servers have heavy loads while other servers have little or
    no load. Load times should not vary based on the file format, such as CSV vs. Avro vs gzip.

<p>Your use of GCP has grown significantly and you now have many resources to manage.
Some resources are in different environments and some are for different teams. You would
like to easily group resources so you can manage them more effectively. What feature of GCP would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). Managed instance groups
b). Snapshots
c). Images
d). Labels

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Labels allow you to specify key-value pairs for grouping resources, for example, a VM cloud be
    labeled with the key value pair 'envior:production.' Images are copies of operating systems, boot
    loaders, and related data that can be used to create boot disks. Snapshots are copies of persistent
    volumes made at a specific point in time. Managed instance groups are used to create sets of
    identically configured VMs that can autoscale.

<p>You would like to display information about a dataset named primarydata in a project called analytics1. What command would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). bq ls --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata
b). bq show --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata
c). bq ls --format=prettyjson analytics1//primarydata
d). bq metadata --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The correct answer is bq show --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata. The bq command is
    used with BigQuery and the show command displays information about a data set. Projects and
    datasets are specified as [project name]:[dataset name]. The option bq ls --format=prettyjson
    analytics1:primarydata is incorrect because it specifies ls instead of show. The option bq
    metadata --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata is incorrect because it specifies metadata
    instead of show. The option bq ls --format=prettyjson analytics1//primarydata is incorrect
    because it specifies ls instead of show and has the wrong syntax for specifying the project and
    dataset names. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/bqcli-reference

<p>A DevOps engineer has just joined your team and needs to review audit logs. Which of the
following roles could you use to grant the needed permissions without granting more permissions than needed to read logs?</p>
<pre><code>a). roles/logging.configWriter
b). roles/logging.bucketWriter
c). roles/logging.admin
d). roles/logging.privateLogsViewer

Correct: d

Explanation:
    roles/logging.privateLogsViewer provides provides read-only access to log entries in logs,
    including private logs. roles/logging.admin would give permission to review logs but would also
    grant other permissions that are not needed. roles/logging.configWriter grants permissions to
    read and write the configurations of logs-based metrics and sinks for exporting logs.
    roles/logging.bucketWriter provides permission to write to a Cloud Storage bucket.

c). resourcemanager.projects.get only
d). resourcemanager.projects.get, resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy, and
    resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy only

Correct: d

Explanation:
    The permissions, resourcemanager.projects.get, for retrieving projects identified by a project ID,
    resourcemanager.projects.getIamPolicy, for getting IAM access control policy for the specified
    Project, and resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy, for setting IAM access control policy for

b). Add tags with the gcloud container images add-tag command.
c). Set the account parameter when creating the images.
d). Add configurations with the gcloud container images add-configuration command.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Tags are used to group resources in GCP. They are added to images using the gcloud container
    images add-tag command. add-tag is not a valid command. Setting the billing account when
    creating an image is not a valid option. The add-configuration command is not a valid option.

<p>A game developer is using App Engine to run several services. One of the services queries a
Datastore database for user information. Queries over a single property work correctly but
queries that reference two or more properties are not returning any data. You have been
asked to help diagnose the problem. Which file in the application would you look to first to diagnose the problem?</p>
<pre><code>a). dispatch.yaml
b). index.yaml
c). cron.yaml
d). app.yaml

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Index.yaml files contain indexes for complex queries that reference more than one attribute.
    Datastore automatically creates indexes for single attributes. All queries must have a supporting
    index. App.yaml is for application specifications. Cron.yaml is for scheduled jobs.
    Dispatch.yaml is for overriding routing rules.

<p>A developer has to work with several clients all using Google Cloud. They would like to
easily switch between clients when working on the command line. What would you recommend they do?</p>
<pre><code>a). Create a configuration for each client and use the gcloud auth command to activate the
    appropriate configuration for each client.
b). Create a policy for each client and use the gcloud policy command to activate the appropriate
    policy for each client.
c). Create a configuration for each client and use the gcloud config configurations activate
    command to activate the appropriate configuration for each client.
d). Create a policy for each client and use the gcloud auth-policy command to activate the
    appropriate policy for each client.

Correct: c

Explanation:
    The gcloud config configurations activate command allows for rapid changes to the
    configuration for the Cloud SDK and could be used for that purpose in this use case. gcloud auth
    is not used to activate a configuration. Policies are not used to specify command line
    configurations.

What mechanisms could you use to differentiate resource usage?</p>
<pre><code>a). instance attributes
b). Namespaces
c). key-value pairs
d). Guest attributes
e). Labels

Correct: e

Explanation:
    Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects to specify identifying attributes of objects
    that are useful for users and admins. Namespaces are virtual clusters designed for environments
    like the one described, with many users, team, or other organization group structures

b). gcloud disk images create devimage1 --source-snapshot devsnapshot1
c). gcloud disk create devimage1 --source-snapshot devsnapshot1
d). gcloud images create devimage1 --source-snapshot devsnapshot1

Correct: a

Explanation:
    Images are Compute Engine resources so they use gcloud compute commands. Images are the
    resource that is being created so the command is gcloud compute images create followed by the
    image name and the source-snapshot parameter. gcloud disk and gcloud image are not valid
    gcloud commands.

<pre><code>a). Policy Denied Audit Log
b). Identity Access Audit Log
c). Admin Activity Log
d). Data Access Audit Log

Correct: a

Explanation:
    The Policy Denied Audit Log captures details when a user or service account is denied access
    because of a security policy violation. The Admin Activity Log tracks administrative actions
    including changes to configurations and metadata. The Data Access Audit Log tracks changes or
    reads of resource data or metadata. There is no Identity Access Audit Log in GCP.

c). gsutil newclass -s STORAGE_CLASS gs://PATH_TO_OBJECT
d). gcloud storage newclass -s STORAGE_CLASS gs://PATH_TO_OBJECT

Correct: a

Explanation:
    Gsutil is the command line utility for Cloud Storage. The rewrite command with the -s parameter
    is used to change storage classes. gcloud storage rewrite -s STORAGE_CLASS
    gs://PATH_TO_OBJECT and gcloud storage newclass -s STORAGE_CLASS
    gs://PATH_TO_OBJECT are incorrect options because they use gcloud instead of gsutil. gsutil
    newclass -s STORAGE_CLASS gs://PATH_TO_OBJECT is incorrect, gsutil newclass is not a

service would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Cloud Bigtable
b). Cloud BigQuery
c). Cloud Spanner
d). Cloud SQL

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Cloud Spanner is a globally scalable, managed relational database that supports consistency.
    Cloud Bigtable is a NoSQL database. BigQuery is an analytical database. Cloud SQL is a
    relational database but it is designed for regional use cases.

c). managed instance groups
d). instance templates

Correct: c

<p>A distributed application uses Cloud Pub/Sub to send messages to a service that analyzes
the data. Each message should only be sent once but for some reason, messages are sent
repeatedly. What configuration parameter would you investigate in order to correct this problem?</p>
<pre><code>a). --max-retry-delay
b). --ack-deadline
c). --dead-letter-topic
d). min-retry-delay

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The problem may be caused by the consuming application not acknowledging the message has
    been successfully processed within the time required. The --ack-deadline may be set too low and
    the consuming application may not send the acknowledgement within that time. Increasing the
    --ack-deadline would give the consuming application more time to acknowledge successful
    processing of the message. Dead-letter-topics are specified to receive messages that cannot be
    acknowledged. --max-retry-delay is the maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a
    given message. The min-retry-delay is the minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a
    given message. Changing either the max or min retry delay will not affect acknowledging a
    message, which is the root cause of the problem.

<p>You are working in Cloud Shell to diagnose a problem with a Cloud SQL server running
MySQL. You would like to connect to the MySQL instance from the command line. What
command would you use to connect to the database as root using the built-in client?
[INSTANCE-ID] is the database instance identifier.</p>
<pre><code>a). gcloud sql connect [INSTANCE-ID] --user=root
b). gcloud mysql connect [INSTANCE-IP] --user=root
c). gcloud mysql --host=[INSTANCE -D] --user=root
d). gsutil sql connect [INSTANCE-ID] --user=root

Correct: a

Explanation:
    To use the client built into Cloud Shell, the correct command is gcloud sql connect followed by
    the instance ID of the database you want to connect to along with the --user parameter to specify
    the username. The option mysql --host=[INSTANCE -D] --user=root. Both of the options,
    gcloud mysql --host=[INSTANCE -D] --user=root and gcloud mysql connect [INSTANCE-IP] --
    user=root, use gcloud mysql instead of gcloud sql and so are incorrect. Also gcloud mysql
    connect [INSTANCE-IP] --user=root specifies an IP address instead of an instance identifier.
    gsutil sql connect [INSTANCE-ID] --user=root is incorrect because gcloud is used with Cloud
    SQL and gsutil is command line utility used with Cloud Storage.

Correct: d

Explanation:
    The correct answer is Network TCP/UDP Load Balancing, which is used for internal TCP traffic.
    SSL Proxy is used for external TCP trafficand SSL processing is offloaded to the the proxy.
    Network TCP/UDP Load Balancing is used for internal TCP traffic. TCP Proxy Load Balancing
    is a reverse proxy load balancer that distributes TCP traffic coming from the internet to virtual

complete. If a simulation fails before completing, it is restarted on another VM. The
epidemiologists would like to minimize the GCP costs without increasing the time need to
complete a simulation. What would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Use preemptible virtual machine instances.
b). Use more virtual machine instances.
c). Use sole-tenant VMS.
d). Use Shielded VM instances.

Correct: a

Explanation:
    Preemptible VMs cost significantly less then standard priced VMs. Preemptible VMs run up to
    24 hours before being shut down by Google. The epidemiologist can tolerate failures in some
    simulations since failed simulation are re-run.

<pre><code>a). gcloud project-info describe --project [PROJECT-ID]
b). gcloud project info describe
c). gcloud project info list
d). gcloud compute project-info describe --project [PROJECT-ID]

Correct: d

Explanation:
    This is a compute service setting so you would use gcloud compute and the resource is a project
    so project-info is required. The correct command is gcloud compute project-info describe --
    project [PROJECT ID]. The options gcloud project info describe, gcloud project-info describe --
    project [PROJECT ID], and gcloud project info list are not valid gcloud commands, they do not
    specify compute, which is the name of the service the gcloud command applies to.

<p>An app development team wants to develop a service written in C++ that can process a file
after it is uploaded to Cloud Storage. The processing time varies based on the size and
complexity of the content of the file. Almost all files can be processed in less than 1 minute
but some files can take up to 20 minutes to process. The developers are already using
containers and Cloud Pub/Sub for other services. They plan to use Cloud Storage's trigger
mechanism to send a message to Pub/Sub on upload. You want to minimize operational
overhead while ensuring all files are processed correctly. What GCP compute service would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). Anthos
b). Compute Engine
c). App Engine Standard
d). Cloud Run

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Cloud Run can execute container images with custom applications written in any programming
    language. It is a managed service so operational overhead is minimized. Cloud Pub/Sub
    configured with a push subscription could invoke a service running in Cloud Run. Compute
    Engine is not a managed service and would have more operational overhead. App Engine
    Standard does not support C++ applications. Anthos is a platform for managing multiple
    Kubernetes clusters in multiple environments and while it could be used to run the service, it is
    more than required by the specifications.

managed GCP database service would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Bigtable
b). Cloud Spanner
c). Cloud SQL
d). BigQuery

Correct: a

Explanation:
    Bigtable is a NoSQL wide-column database well suited to low latency writes. Since only a few,
    well defined query patterns are needed, you can design the data model to support those patterns.
    BigQuery does not support large volumes of low latency writes. Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner
    are relational databases designed for transaction processing systems but this use case does not
    require a transaction processing system.

<p>The CFO of your company is concerned that BigQuery costs are growing too large. They
ask for recommendations on how to reduce the cost of querying without reducing the utility
of the service. Most of the queries are based on the time the data arrived. What would you
recommend as one way to reduce the amount of data scanned?</p>
<pre><code>a). Use the LIMIT option in SELECT statements to prevent more than a fixed number of rows from being
    returned.
b). Use covering indexes to respond to queries using only the index without needing to seek additional
    blocks of data.
c). Use ingestion time partitioned tables and specify _PARTITIONTIME filters when querying.
d). Use read replicas and query only the read replica not the primary, which is where data is written.

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Ingestion time partitioned tables creates partitions by ingestion time. The pseudo column
    _PARTITIONTIME is added to the table and can be used to restrict the amount of data scanned.
    BigQuery does not provide for read replicas like some databases. BigQuery does not use indexes.
    The LIMIT option does not reduce the amount of data scanned, it only limits the number of rows 
    returned.

charges. Which type of audit log would you think could be responsible?</p>
<pre><code>a). Policy Denied Audit Log
b). System Event Audit Log
c). Data Access Audit Log
d). Admin Activity audit logs

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Data Access Audit logs generate large amounts of data and are disabled by default for most
    services; it is enabled by default for BigQuery. The other audit logs are not likely to generate the
    same volume of data as the Data Access Audit logs.

<pre><code>a). LoadBalancer
b). ClusterIP
c). Headless
d). NodePort

Correct: b

Explanation:
    ClusterIP service is the default type of service and is used to enable internal clients to send
    requests to a stable internal IP address. Headless service type is used when a stable IP address is
    not needed. NodePort is used to enable clients to send requests to the IP address of a node on one
    or more nodePort values specified by the service. LoadBalancer clients send request to the IP
    address of a network load balancer.

<p>A data scientist is running several large queries against BigQuery. They would like to know
how much the query will cost before running the query. How would recommend they do that?</p>
<pre><code>a). Use the bq query command with the --dry_run flag
b). Use the bq query command with the --cost flag
c). Use the bq query command with the --limit parameter and the --scan parameter
d). Use the bq query command with the --estimate-cost flag

Correct: a

Explanation:
    The --dry_run flag is used with the bq query command to estimate the cost of running a query.
    bq does not have --estimate-cost or --cost flags. There is --scan parameter in bq. Limit can be
    used with SQL queries to limit the number of rows returned but it does not limit the amount of
    data scanned. Since it is the amount of data scanned, not returned, that determines cost, using a
    limit statement will not help reduce cost.
