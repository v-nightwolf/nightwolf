<p>A team of developers would like to have a standard work environment in Compute Engine.
You would like to be able to create multiple instances with identical configurations. The
configurations should be easy to change. What feature of Compute Engine would you use to specify the configuration?</p>
<pre><code>a). snapshot
b). managed instance groups
c). instance template
d). unmanaged instance groups

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Instance templates specify the configuration of virtual machines and managed instance groups.
    Unmanaged instance groups may be heterogeneous and do not use instance templates. Snapshots
    are copies of disks at a point in time. They are useful for backups and copying disks but are not
    used for specifying configurations.

followed by sensor ID, such as 20210101sensorABCD for a file with data from a sensor
called ABCD on January 1, 2021. The loads are not proceeding as quickly as expected.
What might be the cause of the slower than expected upload?</p>
<pre><code>a). The files are in gzip format instead of Avro format.
b). The file names use the date as the first part of the filename so they may be creating hotspots 
    when writing data to Cloud Storage.
c). The files are in CSV instead of Avro format.
d). The data in files is being encrypted before being persisted to storage.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Files are written to servers within the Cloud Storage system based on filenames. Lexically close
    file names are written to the same server. This can lead to hotspotting, which is an imbalance in
    workload that has a small number of servers doing more work than other servers. Data is always
    encrypted before being persisted to storage so there should be no unexpected overhead for
    encrypting data. The size of the file not the format is the primary determiner of how long a file
    will take to load. tspots in which a few servers have heavy loads while other servers have little or
    no load. Load times should not vary based on the file format, such as CSV vs. Avro vs gzip.

<p>Your use of GCP has grown significantly and you now have many resources to manage.
Some resources are in different environments and some are for different teams. You would
like to easily group resources so you can manage them more effectively. What feature of GCP would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). Managed instance groups
b). Snapshots
c). Images
d). Labels

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Labels allow you to specify key-value pairs for grouping resources, for example, a VM cloud be
    labeled with the key value pair 'envior:production.' Images are copies of operating systems, boot
    loaders, and related data that can be used to create boot disks. Snapshots are copies of persistent
    volumes made at a specific point in time. Managed instance groups are used to create sets of
    identically configured VMs that can autoscale.

b). bq show --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata
c). bq ls --format=prettyjson analytics1//primarydata
d). bq metadata --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The correct answer is bq show --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata. The bq command is
    used with BigQuery and the show command displays information about a data set. Projects and
    datasets are specified as [project name]:[dataset name]. The option bq ls --format=prettyjson
    analytics1:primarydata is incorrect because it specifies ls instead of show. The option bq
    metadata --format=prettyjson analytics1:primarydata is incorrect because it specifies metadata
    instead of show. The option bq ls --format=prettyjson analytics1//primarydata is incorrect
    because it specifies ls instead of show and has the wrong syntax for specifying the project and
    dataset names. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/bqcli-reference

<pre><code>a). roles/logging.configWriter
b). roles/logging.bucketWriter
c). roles/logging.admin
d). roles/logging.privateLogsViewer

Correct: d

Explanation:
    roles/logging.privateLogsViewer provides provides read-only access to log entries in logs,
    including private logs. roles/logging.admin would give permission to review logs but would also
    grant other permissions that are not needed. roles/logging.configWriter grants permissions to
    read and write the configurations of logs-based metrics and sinks for exporting logs.
    roles/logging.bucketWriter provides permission to write to a Cloud Storage bucket.

b). Add tags with the gcloud container images add-tag command.
c). Set the account parameter when creating the images.
d). Add configurations with the gcloud container images add-configuration command.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Tags are used to group resources in GCP. They are added to images using the gcloud container
    images add-tag command. add-tag is not a valid command. Setting the billing account when
    creating an image is not a valid option. The add-configuration command is not a valid option.

<p>A developer has to work with several clients all using Google Cloud. They would like to
easily switch between clients when working on the command line. What would you recommend they do?</p>
<pre><code>a). Create a configuration for each client and use the gcloud auth command to activate the

    command to activate the appropriate configuration for each client.
d). Create a policy for each client and use the gcloud auth-policy command to activate the
    appropriate policy for each client.

Correct: c

Explanation:
    The gcloud config configurations activate command allows for rapid changes to the
    configuration for the Cloud SDK and could be used for that purpose in this use case. gcloud auth
    is not used to activate a configuration. Policies are not used to specify command line

b). gcloud disk images create devimage1 --source-snapshot devsnapshot1
c). gcloud disk create devimage1 --source-snapshot devsnapshot1
d). gcloud images create devimage1 --source-snapshot devsnapshot1

Correct: a

Explanation:
    Images are Compute Engine resources so they use gcloud compute commands. Images are the
    resource that is being created so the command is gcloud compute images create followed by the
    image name and the source-snapshot parameter. gcloud disk and gcloud image are not valid
    gcloud commands.

<p>A distributed application uses Cloud Pub/Sub to send messages to a service that analyzes
the data. Each message should only be sent once but for some reason, messages are sent
repeatedly. What configuration parameter would you investigate in order to correct this problem?</p>
<pre><code>a). --max-retry-delay
b). --ack-deadline
c). --dead-letter-topic
d). min-retry-delay

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The problem may be caused by the consuming application not acknowledging the message has
    been successfully processed within the time required. The --ack-deadline may be set too low and
    the consuming application may not send the acknowledgement within that time. Increasing the
    --ack-deadline would give the consuming application more time to acknowledge successful
    processing of the message. Dead-letter-topics are specified to receive messages that cannot be
    acknowledged. --max-retry-delay is the maximum delay between consecutive deliveries of a
    given message. The min-retry-delay is the minimum delay between consecutive deliveries of a
    given message. Changing either the max or min retry delay will not affect acknowledging a
    message, which is the root cause of the problem.

[INSTANCE-ID] is the database instance identifier.</p>
<pre><code>a). gcloud sql connect [INSTANCE-ID] --user=root
b). gcloud mysql connect [INSTANCE-IP] --user=root
c). gcloud mysql --host=[INSTANCE -D] --user=root
d). gsutil sql connect [INSTANCE-ID] --user=root

Correct: a

Explanation:
    To use the client built into Cloud Shell, the correct command is gcloud sql connect followed by
    the instance ID of the database you want to connect to along with the --user parameter to specify
    the username. The option mysql --host=[INSTANCE -D] --user=root. Both of the options,
    gcloud mysql --host=[INSTANCE -D] --user=root and gcloud mysql connect [INSTANCE-IP] --
    user=root, use gcloud mysql instead of gcloud sql and so are incorrect. Also gcloud mysql
    connect [INSTANCE-IP] --user=root specifies an IP address instead of an instance identifier.
    gsutil sql connect [INSTANCE-ID] --user=root is incorrect because gcloud is used with Cloud
    SQL and gsutil is command line utility used with Cloud Storage.

d). gcloud compute project-info describe --project [PROJECT-ID]

Correct: d

Explanation:
    This is a compute service setting so you would use gcloud compute and the resource is a project
    so project-info is required. The correct command is gcloud compute project-info describe --
    project [PROJECT ID]. The options gcloud project info describe, gcloud project-info describe --
    project [PROJECT ID], and gcloud project info list are not valid gcloud commands, they do not
    specify compute, which is the name of the service the gcloud command applies to.

<p>An app development team wants to develop a service written in C++ that can process a file
after it is uploaded to Cloud Storage. The processing time varies based on the size and
complexity of the content of the file. Almost all files can be processed in less than 1 minute
but some files can take up to 20 minutes to process. The developers are already using
containers and Cloud Pub/Sub for other services. They plan to use Cloud Storage's trigger
mechanism to send a message to Pub/Sub on upload. You want to minimize operational
overhead while ensuring all files are processed correctly. What GCP compute service would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). Anthos
b). Compute Engine
c). App Engine Standard
d). Cloud Run

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Cloud Run can execute container images with custom applications written in any programming
    language. It is a managed service so operational overhead is minimized. Cloud Pub/Sub
    configured with a push subscription could invoke a service running in Cloud Run. Compute
    Engine is not a managed service and would have more operational overhead. App Engine
    Standard does not support C++ applications. Anthos is a platform for managing multiple
    Kubernetes clusters in multiple environments and while it could be used to run the service, it is
    more than required by the specifications.

managed GCP database service would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Bigtable
b). Cloud Spanner
c). Cloud SQL
d). BigQuery

Correct: a

Explanation:
    Bigtable is a NoSQL wide-column database well suited to low latency writes. Since only a few,
    well defined query patterns are needed, you can design the data model to support those patterns.
    BigQuery does not support large volumes of low latency writes. Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner
    are relational databases designed for transaction processing systems but this use case does not
    require a transaction processing system.

<p>The CFO of your company is concerned that BigQuery costs are growing too large. They
ask for recommendations on how to reduce the cost of querying without reducing the utility
of the service. Most of the queries are based on the time the data arrived. What would you
recommend as one way to reduce the amount of data scanned?</p>
<pre><code>a). Use the LIMIT option in SELECT statements to prevent more than a fixed number of rows from being
    returned.
b). Use covering indexes to respond to queries using only the index without needing to seek additional
    blocks of data.
c). Use ingestion time partitioned tables and specify _PARTITIONTIME filters when querying.
d). Use read replicas and query only the read replica not the primary, which is where data is written.

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Ingestion time partitioned tables creates partitions by ingestion time. The pseudo column
    _PARTITIONTIME is added to the table and can be used to restrict the amount of data scanned.
    BigQuery does not provide for read replicas like some databases. BigQuery does not use indexes.
    The LIMIT option does not reduce the amount of data scanned, it only limits the number of rows 
    returned.

    not needed. NodePort is used to enable clients to send requests to the IP address of a node on one
    or more nodePort values specified by the service. LoadBalancer clients send request to the IP
    address of a network load balancer.

<p>A data scientist is running several large queries against BigQuery. They would like to know
how much the query will cost before running the query. How would recommend they do that?</p>
<pre><code>a). Use the bq query command with the --dry_run flag
b). Use the bq query command with the --cost flag
c). Use the bq query command with the --limit parameter and the --scan parameter
d). Use the bq query command with the --estimate-cost flag

Correct: a

Explanation:
    The --dry_run flag is used with the bq query command to estimate the cost of running a query.
    bq does not have --estimate-cost or --cost flags. There is --scan parameter in bq. Limit can be
    used with SQL queries to limit the number of rows returned but it does not limit the amount of
    data scanned. Since it is the amount of data scanned, not returned, that determines cost, using a
    limit statement will not help reduce cost.

in the project. What command would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). bq ls
b). gsutil ls
c). gsutil dir
d). bq dir

Correct: a

Explanation:
    BigQuery uses the bq command line and the command to list datasets is bq ls. bq dir is not a
    valid bq command. Gsutil is the command line utility used with Cloud Storage not BigQuery.

<p>You believe you may have over provisioned several VMs. You would like to get data on the
CPU load at 15 minute intervals from all Linux servers. How would you do this with the least amount of work?</p>
<pre><code>a). Install the Prometheus agent on each server and monitor the load_15m metric.
b). Install a bash script that uses the sar -u command to get CPU utilization and write the value to sysout.
c). Install the Cloud Monitoring agent on each server and monitor the load_15m metric.
d). Install a bash script that uses the sar -u command to get CPU utilization and write the value to syslog.

Correct: c

Explanation:
    The Cloud Monitoring agent collects data on CPU utilization and other metrics. Installing the
    agent and then view the collected data with Cloud Monitoring requires the least amount of work.
    Installing a bash script that uses the sar -u command to get CPU utilization and write the value to
    syslog or sysout would work but would require you to write and maintain the script. Prometheus
    is an open source monitoring tool that could be used but you would need to install, configure,
    and maintain it.

<p>You have deployed a service using App Engine that requires a batch job run every hour.
You notice that the batch job is running every two hours instead of every hour. You'd like
to change the job specification to correct the problem. What file would you edit to correct the problem?</p>
<pre><code>a). app.yaml
b). batch.yaml
c). job.yaml
d). cron.yaml

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Cron.yaml files contain specifications for running scheduled jobs in App Engine. App.yaml has
    overall application specifications. Batch.yaml and job.yaml are not specified as part of App
    Engine services.

<p>You want to create an autoscaling Kubernetes cluster in Kubernetes Engine. Which of the
following commands would you specify?</p>
<pre><code>a). kubectl containers create with --enable-autoscaling flag and --min-nodes and max-nodes parameters.
b). gcloud container clusters create with --enable-autoscaling flag and --min-nodes and maxnodes parameters.
c). gcloud kubernetes clusters create with --enable-autoscaling flag and --min-nodes and maxnodes parameters.
d). kubectl clusters create with --enable-autoscaling flag and --min-nodes and max-nodes parameters.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The correct command is gcloud container clusters create with --enable-autoscaling flag and --min-nodes
    and max-nodes parameters. Kubectl is a command line for managing resources, such as pods, within a
    Kubernetes cluster so the options kubectl clusters create with --enableautoscaling flag and
    --min-nodes and max-nodes parameters and kubectl containers create with --enable-autoscaling flag and
    --min-nodes and max-nodes parameters are incorrect. The option gcloud kubernetes clusters create with
    --enable-autoscaling flag and --min-nodes and max-nodes parameters is incorrect because it specifies
    gcloud kubernetes instead of gcloud containers.
    (Kubernetes Engine was originally named Container Engine. When the service name was changed, the gcloud
    command was not changed to reflect the new service name).

b). The explanation was pasted here. Was "Internal HTTP(S) Load Balancing" supposed to go here, like
    the question below?
c). TCP Proxy
d). Network TCP/UDP Load Balancing

Correct: a

Explanation:
    The correct answer is the SSL Proxy, which should be used for external TCP traffic with the SSL
    processing offloaded to the the proxy. Network TCP/UDP Load Balancing is used for internal TCP traffic.
    A network load balancer distributes TCP or UDP traffic among virtual machine (VM) instances in the same
    region.

<p>You have created a virtual private cloud (VPC) in auto mode, which automatically creates
a subnet in each region. How is the CIDR block determined for each region?</p>
<pre><code>a). Each region will automatically be assigned a set of predefined IP ranges that fit within the
    10.128.0.0/9 CIDR block.
b). You will specify non-overlapping CIDR blocks for each region.
c). You will specify non-overlapping CIDR ranges for the set of regions you want a subnet created for.
d). Each region will be automatically assigned a range of external IP addresses.

Correct: a

Explanation:
    When using auto mode VPC creation, a subnet is created in each region and each subnet is assigned a
    range of IP addresses that fit within the 10.128.0.0/9 CIDR block. You do not have to specify CIDR
    blocks in auto mode so both of the options, You will specify non-overlapping CIDR blocks for each
    region and You will specify non-overlapping CIDR ranges for the set of regions you want a subnet
    created for, are incorrect. External addresses are not assigned in auto mode, so the option each
    region will be automatically assigned a range of external IP addresses is incorrect.

<p>A colleague who is new to GCP has asked for your help with understanding predefined
roles. They would like to know details about several predefined roles. What command
would you suggest they use? [ROLE-ID] indicates where to specify the role identifier in the command.</p>
<pre><code>a). gcloud iam roles describe [ROLE-ID]
b). gcloud roles predefined describe [ROLE-ID]
c). gcloud iam roles list [ROLE-ID]
d). gcloud roles predefined describe [ROLE-ID]

Correct: a

Explanation:
    gcloud iam roles describe [ROLE-ID] is the correct command for displaying information about a role.
    The options gcloud roles predefined describe [ROLE-ID] and gcloud roles predefined describe [ROLE-ID]
    are missing the term iam, which is needed to indicate the gcloud command is for the Identity and
    Access Management service. The option gcloud iam roles list [ROLE-ID] uses list instead of describe.
    List is typically used to see short descriptions of multiple resources while describe is typically
    used to see more detailed information about a resource.

What feature of Compute Engine would you use for this purpose?</p>
<pre><code>a). community supported images
b). managed instance groups
c). image families
d). unmanaged instance groups

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Image families are used to group related images together so you can roll forward or back
    between specific images versions. Image families always point to the latest version of an image
    that is not deprecated. Managed and unmanaged instance groups are types of clusters, not an
    image management feature. Community supported images not directly supported by Compute
    Engine and are maintained by community members.

<p>You are hosting a large amount of image and video content for an educational service.
Learners from around the world use the service. You currently host content on servers in
your own data center in North America. Learners in Asia, Africa, and Europe experience
long latencies loading content. What GCP service could you use to ensure that all learners
experience the same level of latency and the latency is kept low, especially for frequently
accessed content?</p>
<pre><code>a). Persistent disks
b). Cloud CDN
c). Cloud Storage Nearline Storage Class
d). Cloud VPN

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Cloud CDN is a content distribution network for global content delivery. It caches data at
    distributed points around the world so users requests for content are routed to the closest content
    location. Cloud Storage Nearline Storage Class is appropriate for content that is only accessed
    once or less per month. Cloud VPNs are used to link Google Cloud network to external networks,
    such as an on premises data center network. Persistent disks are used to store data on virtual
    machines and could be used if you were to deploy and manage VMs across multiple regions but that
    would be less efficient than using Cloud CDN.

<p>Due to security concerns, you want to ensure all data written to your Cloud Storage
buckets are encrypted. What do you need to do to ensure data is encrypted when stored in Cloud Storage?</p>
<pre><code>a). Set up customer managed encryption keys and use those keys to encrypt data before saving to Cloud Storage.
b). Set a lifecycle policy that specifies encryption is on.
c). Use the --encrypt flag with gsutil
d). Nothing, this is the default behavior.

Correct: d

Explanation:
    All data stored in Google Cloud is encrypted before it is persisted. You do not have to do
    anything to ensure your data is encrypted at rest in GCP. You may set up customer managed
    encryption keys if you want to control how keys are managed but it is not necessary. There is no
    --encrypt flag with gsutil. There is no encryption option with lifecycle management policies.

<p>A startup is developing an Internet of Things (IoT) service. When data is first ingested,
some basic data quality checks are performed that ensure the format is correct. The checks
are simple Python functions that apply regular expression checks. The data will be ingested
using Pub/Sub. When new data arrives, it should be automatically have the quality checks
applied. The checks will always run for less than one second. What compute service would
you use to apply the data quality checks?</p>
<pre><code>a). App Engine Standard
b). Compute Engine
c). Cloud Functions
d). App Engine Flexible

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Cloud Functions are the best option since it is a managed service that can be invoked on events,
    such as when a message is ingested by Cloud Pub/Sub. Cloud Functions support Python. Also
    the code to execute runs for short periods of time. Compute Engine could be used but you would
    be charged for time the VM is running even if it were not processing data and would require
    more management than Cloud Functions, which is serverless. App Engine Standard and App
    Engine Flexible could be used but they provide more functionality than is needed to run simple
    Python functions applying regular expression checks and require more configuration than Cloud Functions.

<p>A team providing business intelligence solutions to your company is migrating to GCP.
They make extensive use of SQL and want to continue to use SQL. They currently use
relational databases to store data. Data is loaded every night. When data is older than 3
years, it is no longer needed. They expect the database to grow to 100 GB within six
months. Most of the operations on the database query a few columns but scan many rows.
They also want to minimize database management overhead. What GCP service would you
recommend they use?</p>
<pre><code>a). Bigtable
b). BigQuery
c). Cloud Firestore
d). Cloud SQL

Correct: b

Explanation:
    BigQuery is the best option. BigQuery is a managed analytical database that supports SQL. It is
    optimized for write once/read many operations. It can easily store 100 GB or more of data. It is a
    managed service designed to support data warehouses. Bigtable and Cloud Firestore are NoSQL
    databases and do not support SQL. Cloud SQL does support SQL but it is designed for
    transaction processing and does not support up to 100 GB in a single database.

<pre><code>a). roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1
b). roles/compute.imageUser
c). roles/compute.storageAdmin
d). roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator
e). roles/iam.serviceAccountUser

Correct: a, e

Explanation:
    2 roles are required: roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 and roles/iam.serviceAccountUser. The
    roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1 role gives full control of Compute Engine instances, instance
    groups, disks, snapshots, and images. The roles/iam.serviceAccountUser role gives permission to
    run operations as the service account. roles/compute.storageAdmin gives only permissions to
    create, modify, and delete disks, images, and snapshots, which are available by
    roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1. roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator gives permission to create
    service accounts.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The command gcloud compute images list --project windows-cloud --no-standard-images will
    list Windows Server images. List provides a list of images with minimal information. Describe is
    used to show more detailed information. The options gcloud compute list windows-cloud, gcloud

b). gsutil list gs://BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_NAME
c). gsutil metadata gs://BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_NAME
d). gsutil describe gs://BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_NAME

Correct: a

Explanation:
    The correct command to list that metadata is gsutil stat gs://BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_NAME.
    gsutil metadata is not a valid gsutil command. gsutil list is not a valid command, instead gsutil ls
    is used to list bucket information. gsutil describe is not a valid command. Describe is often used
    with gcloud commands, but not gsutil.

<pre><code>a). Preemptible VMs
b). Sole-tenant nodes
c). Managed instance groups
d). Shielded VMs

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Sole-tenant nodes provide for exclusive access to a physical server. Shielded VMs provide
    additional security protections but do not guarantee sole-tenancy. Managed instance groups is a
    set of identically configured VMs. Preemptible VMs are low cost VMs that may be shutdown at

d). guest attributes

Correct: d

Explanation:
    The correct answer is guest attributes. When guest attributes are enabled, Compute Engine will
    store your generated host keys as guest attributes. Sole-tenant nodes provides for exclusive
    access to a physical server. Shielded VMs provide additional security protections but do not
    guarantee sole-tenancy. Labels allow you to specify key-value pairs for grouping resources, for
    example, a VM cloud be labeled with the key value pair 'envior:production.'

<p>You are running several services in Cloud Run. You will need to programmatically
determine the name of the configuration that created the container. Where would you find this?</p>
<pre><code>a). In the container startup script
b). In the service startup script
c). In the K_Configuration environment variable
d). In the VM instance metadata

Correct: c

Explanation:
    When Cloud Run starts a container, it creates environment variables: K_Configuration,
    K_Revision, K_Service, and Port. K_Configuration specifies the configuration that created the
    container. When using Docker containers, you specify a command to execute on startup using
    the CMD command in a Dockerfile configuration. Container startup or service startup scripts do
    not necessarily set a standard environment variable for storing metadata, such as the name of the
    configuration used with Cloud Run. VM instance data is incorrect because Cloud Run is
    serverless and we do not have access to underlying VMs.
