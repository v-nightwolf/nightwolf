       We use “&amp;” symbol to execute a job in back ground. When we execute a job or process in unix it starts
       executing in the prompt itself and we can’t do other stuffs in the command prompt at that time. So until
       unless the process gets executed we have to seat idle. So for continuous interaction with the command
       prompt we prefer executing the jobs or processes in back ground.

            The second-stage, boot loader called the kernel loader.
            The first- and second-stage boot loaders combined are calledGRand Unified Bootloader.
            With stage 2 loaded, GRUB can display a list of available kernels You can select a kernel parameters.

   120. Explained about File System Labels?
        File system labels are useful where you need to address the file system that is on the device.
        The file system label is set, you can use it when mounting the device.
        The name replace to device by LABEL=labelname to do this

        To add a lable on ext3 filesystems
        # mkfs.ext4 -L mylabel /dev/sda2

        To add a lable on exitsting filesystems
        # tune2fs -L mylabel /dev/sda2

   121. To convert ext2 to ext3 filesystem?
        # tune2fs -j /dev/hda4 =&gt; Do it on your own risk. I would recommend to create a new filesystem of ext3 
          and copy the data from ext2 to ext3.

   122. To convert ext3 to ext2 filesystem?
        # tune2fs -O^has-journal /dev/hda1 =&gt; Do it on your own risk. I would recommend to create a new 
          filesystem of ext2 and copy the data from ext3 to ext2.

   123. To convert ext2 to ext4 filesystem?
        # tune2fs -O dir_index,has_journal,uninit_bg /dev/hdXX
        # e2fsck -pf /dev/hdXX

   124. To convert ext3 to ext4 filesystem?
        umount /dev/sda2
        tune2fs -O extents,uninit_bg,dir_index /dev/sda2
        e2fsck -pf /dev/sda2
        mount /dev/sda2 /home

   125. Explained Hash Tables?
        The bash shell maintains a hash table for each command which has been run. The reason, why it does so
        is, making the commands run faster.
        Whenever, a user runs a command on the shell, it first has to search the command executable as to where
        is it located.
        whenever the first time bash shell, finds the location of a command executable, it adds it to a hash table.
        The next time, same command is run,
        the path is taken from the hash table rather than searched again making the commands run faster.
         # hash
          hitscommand
          7 /bin/grep
          1 /usr/bin/which
          1 /usr/bin/touch

       Reset the hash table
        # hash -r

       Delete the corresponding entry
        # hash -d myprint

   127. So how do I find out zombie process?
        # ps aux | awk ‘{ print $8 ” ” $2 }’ | grep -w Z
        Output:
         Z 4104
         Z 5320
         Z 2945

   128. How do I kill zombie process?
        ps axo ppid,stat | grep Z | awk ‘{print $1}’ | xargs kill -HUP
        kill -HUP $(ps -A -ostat,ppid | grep -e ‘[zZ]’| awk ‘{ print $2 }’)
        kill -9 $(ps -A -ostat,ppid | grep -e ‘[zZ]’| awk ‘{ print $2 }’)

   129. Details about Backup?
       • full – as the name implies, this is a backup of everything
       • differential – this is a backup of everything since the last full backup
       • incremental – this is a backup of everything since the last _incremental_ backup

         This command will create a backup of /home and put that in the file /tmp/home.tar
         # tar -cvf /tmp/home.tar /home

        Create a backup of the directories /home /var /root and write that to the file /tmp/system-backup.tar
        # tar -cvf /tmp/system-backup.tar /home /var /root

        The following command makes a backup of /home and writes that to the /dev/mt0 device
        # tar -cvf /dev/mt0 /home

   130. To create a compressed archive of the directory /home
        # tar -zcvf /tmp/home.tar.gz /home
        # tar -jcvf /tmp/home.tar.bz2 /home

   131. Extracts the contents of the compressed file
        # tar -zxvf /file.tar.gz
        # tar -jxvf /file.tar.bz2

   132. To check the contents of a tar file
        # tar -tvf file.tgz

   133. Making Device Backups Using dd
        # dd if=/etc/hosts of=/home/somefile
        # dd if=/etc/passwd of=/home/file1
        # dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=4096
        # dd if=backup.tar.gz of=/dev/mt0

   134. To save MBR file backup as boot files in tmp directory
        # dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/bootfiles bs=512 count=1

   135. Determining Filesystem Usage:
        To determine how much disk space is being used for a given partition, logical volume, or
        NFS mount, use the df command.To display the output in “human readable” format, use the -h argument
        to df.
        The du command displays the disk usage totals for each subdirectory and finally the total usage for
        the current directory.Values are in kilobytes.
        # du -hs /etc
        # du -h /vol1/group1/examplefile

   136. Reporting Disk Performance:
        For example, if the access time for a drive suddenly drops, an administrator
        must quickly start troubleshooting the problem to determine if it is a software or hardware issue or
        simply due to lack of free space on the disk.

   137. Displaying Memory Usage with free
        # free -m
        The free command tells you about current memory usage.
        Two types of system memory exist: physical and virtual. To display the amount of free and used memory,
        both physical and virtual (swap), use the free command

   138. Monitoring and Tuning the Kernel:
        Using the /proc Directory
        Instead of executing utilities such as free and top to determine the status of system resources or fdisk
        to view disk partitions, an administrator can gather system information directly from the kernel through
        the /proc filesystem.
        When you view the contents of files in /proc, you are really asking the kernel what the current state is
        for that particular device or subsystem. To view the contents of a special file in /proc, use the cat, 
        less or more file viewing utilities.

   139. Network Information Service (NIS)
        NIS can have only one authoritative server where the original data files are kept
        This authoritative server is called the master NIS server. If your organization is large enough, you may
        need to distribute the load across more than one machine. This can be done by setting up one or more
        secondary (slave) NIS servers.
        # echo “NISDOMAIN=nis.nightwolf.in” &gt;&gt; /etc/sysconfig/network

        # ypserv
          This daemon runs on the NIS server. It listens for queries from clients and responds with answers to
          those queries.

        # ypxfrd
          This daemon is used for propagating and transferring the NIS databases to slave servers.

        # ypbind
          This is the client-side component of NIS. It is responsible for finding an NIS server to be queried
          for information. The ypbind daemon binds NIS clients to an NIS domain. It must be running on any 
          machines running NIS client programs.

   140. Main config file for Yum Server in linux
        # cat /etc/yum.conf
          [main] cachedir=/var/cache/yum
          keepcache=0
          debuglevel=2
          logfile=/var/log/yum.log

          distroverpkg=redhat-release
          tolerant=1
          exactarch=1
          obsoletes=1
          gpgcheck=1
          plugins=1
          metadata_expire=1800

   141. Change User with noLogin Shell:
        # useradd -s /sbin/nologin nightwolf

   142. Add a User with Home Directory, Custom Shell, Custom Comment and UID/GID
        # useradd -m -d /var/www/nightwolf -s /bin/zsh -c “nightwolf web user” -u 1000 -g 1000 nightwolf

   143. Creating a user along with encrypted password in linux
        Encrypt your password using below command
        # openssl passwd -crypt myPa55w0rd
          4VU5GpOSRWbeo

       Now you can use the encrypted the password for your new user
       # useradd -p 4VU5GpOSRWbeo nightwolf

   144. Adding Information to User Account
        # usermod -c “nightwolf user account” nightwolf

   145. Change User Home Directory
        # usermod -d /var/www/ nightwolf

   146. Set User Account Expiry Date
        # usermod -e 2015-03-15 nightwolf

   147. Change User Primary Group
        # usermod -g group_name nightwolf
        set the group_name group as a primary group to the user nightwolf

   148. Adding Group to an Existing User
        # usermod -G nightwolf_test nightwolf
        ‘nightwolf‘ user is added to group called ‘nightwolf_test‘

   149. Change User Login Name
        # usermod -l nightwolf_login_name  nightwolf

   150. Lock User Account

   158. Disk Failure on RAID
        To simulate a disk failure, we’ll use mdadm to tell the kernel that /dev/sdb1 has failed
        # mdadm –manage /dev/md0 –fail /dev/sda7
        # cat /proc/mdstat
          sda7 [F]

   162. userlist_enable vsftpd
        Will load a list of usernames from the filename specified by the userlist_file directive when this
        option is enabled. And if a user tries to log in using a name in this file, that user will be denied 
        access before even being prompted for a password. The default value is NO.

   163. userlist_deny
        This option is examined if the userlist_enable option is active. When its value is set to NO, users 
        will be denied login, unless they are explicitly listed in the file specified by userlist_file. When
        login is denied, the denial is issued before the user is asked for a password; this helps prevent users
        from sending clear text across the network. The default value is YES.

   163. userlist_file
        This option specifies the name of the file to be loaded when the userlist_enable option is active. The
        default value is vsftpd.user_list.

   164. download_enable
        If set to NO, all download requests will be denied permission. The default value is YES.

   165. write_enable
        This option controls whether any FTP commands that change the file system are allowed.
         These commands are used STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE.
         The default value is NO.

   166. UserDir
        This directive defines the subdirectory within each user’s home directory, where users
        can place personal content that they want to make accessible via the web server. This
        directory is usually named public_html and is usually stored under each user’s home
        directory. This option is, of course, dependent on the availability of the mod_userdir
        module in the web server setup.
        A sample usage of this option in the httpd.conf file is
        UserDir disable
        UserDir public_html

   167. ErrorDocument
        The ErrorDocuments directive lets you specify what happens when a client asks for  nonexistent document.
        Specifies a file that the server sends when an error of a specific type occurs. You can also provide a
        text message for an error. Here are some examples:
        ErrorDocument 403 “Sorry, you cannot access this directory”
        ErrorDocument 403 /error/noindex.html
        ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/bad_link.pl
