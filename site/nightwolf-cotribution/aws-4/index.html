be used because ELB can balance the incoming load across the EC2 resources.
Q 228.what is CloudWatch and mention what can we do with it ?
CloudWatch is native service used to monitor our resources and applications in the AWS

First, we need to increase the EBS volumes level to a consistent amount in the AWS
management console. Next step we should use resize2fs command to use the provisioned space
in the Operating system level because an increase in the EBS volumes doesn’t guarantee the
increase in the OS level. For this to happen we should consider increasing the provisioned
space in the operating system level.
Q 234.A company wants to migrate the on-premises servers to the AWS
cloud platform. The company wants to estimate the cost of the machines
that is going to get provisioned in the cloud. How would you proceed to
determine the cost ?
Perform a mapping of the on-premises server’s cores and RAM to the nearest machine types
in the AWS Cloud. Then use the online AWS pricing calculator to estimate the cost of the
machines in the AWS Cloud.
Q 235. A XYZ company is using AWS services for the past one month for
its production servers. They have established a VPN connectivity from onpremises to AWS with a single IPSEC tunnel. During peak production
hours, servers are not reachable in the AWS Cloud due to network
problem. How would you mitigate this problem with minimal cost ?
Considering the cost factor, we should first consider increasing the number if IPSEC tunnels
that are used for the secure connectivity to AWS. If the problem persists even after increasing
the tunnels, consider the other options for better a network.
Q236: What is the Cloud Computing?
Practice of using a network of the remote servers, hosted on the Internet to store, manage,
and process data,
Rather more than a local server or a personal computer is called Cloud Computing.
Companies offering the computing services are called “cloud providers” and typically charge
for cloud.
Computing services based on the usage, similar to how you are billed for water or electricity
at home.
E.g.: AWS, AZURE, IBM BLUEMIX, GOOGLE CLOUD
This cloud model is composed of the five essential characteristics, three service models and
four deployment models.
The primary reasons for the moving to the cloud are: –
 It will never run out of the capacity, since it is a virtually infinite.
 You can access your cloud-based on applications from anywhere, you just need a
device which can Connect to the Internet.
Q237:What is merits of the Cloud Computing?
 Totally free from Maintenance i.e., You do not have to maintain or administer any
infrastructurefor the same.
 Lower Computing Cost.
 Improved Performance.
 Reduced Software Cost.
 Instant Software Updates.
 Unlimited Storage Capacity i.e., It will never run out of the capacity, since it is
virtually infinite.
 Increased Data Reliability.
 Device Independence and the “always on! Anywhere and any of place” i.e., You can
access your Cloud – based on applications from anywhere, you just need a device
which can connect to the Internet.Cloud Computing is the fastest growing part
of the network-based computing. It provides to tremendous.Benefits to customers
of the all sizes: simple users, developers, enterprises and all types of organizations.
Q238:What are the Cloud Computing?
 Lower TCO.
 Reliability, Scalability &amp; Sustainability.
 Secure Store Management.
 Low Capital Expenditure.
 Frees from Internal Resources.
 Utility Based.
 Easy &amp; Agile Deployment.
 Device &amp; Location Independent.
 24 * 7 Support.
 Pay As You Use.
Q239:What are the top 10 advantages of Cloud Computing?
 Pay as you Go Model.
 Increased Mobility.
 Less or No CAPEX.
 High Availability.
 Easy to Manage.
 High Productivity.
 Environment Friendly.
 Less Deployment Time.
 Dynamic Scaling.
 Shared Resources.
Q240:What are the different layers (Service Models) of cloud computing?
Cloud computing consists of the 3 layers in the hierarchy and these are as follows:
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) provides cloud infrastructure in terms of the
hardware like memory, processor speed etc.
2. Platform as a Service (PAAS) provides cloud applications platform for the
developers.
3. Software as a Service (SAAS) provides cloud applications which is used by the user
directly without Installing anything on the system.
Q241:How do disable Password-Based Logins for the Root in Amazon
EC2 Instance?
Using a fixed for the root password for a public AMI is a security risk that can be quickly
become known. Even Relying on users to change the password after to the first login opens a
small window of the opportunity for potential abuses.
Following are the steps to disable password-based on remote logins for the root users.
1.Open the /etc/ssh/sshd config file with an text editor and locate to the following line:</p>
<h1 id="permitrootlogin-yes">PermitRootLogin yes.<a class="headerlink" href="#permitrootlogin-yes" title="Permanent link"></a></h1>
<p>2.Change to the line to:
PermitRoot Login without-password.
Q242:How can I take an Snapshot of a RAID Array?
Problem – Take an snapshot excludes data held in the cache by the applications and the OS.
This tends not to matter on a single volume, however using a multiple volumes in the RAID
Array, this can be a problem due to inter dependencies of arrays.
Q243:What is the difference between Volume and Snapshot in the
Amazon Web Services?
In Amazon Web Services, a Volume is durables, block level storage can device that can be
attached to a singles EC2 instance. In plain words it is like an hard disk on which we can be
write or read from.A Snapshot is created by copying the data of volume to the another
location at a specific time. We can even replicate samen of Snapshot to multiple availability
zones. So, Snapshot is the single point in time view of a volume. We can create an Snapshot
only when we have a Volumes. Also, from a Snapshot we can create an Volumes. In AWS, we
have to pay for the storage that is used by Volume as well as the one used by a Snapshots.
Q244:What happens if my application to stops responding to requests in
beanstalk?
AWS Beanstalk applications have an system in place for avoiding to failures in the
underlying infrastructures.
Q245:How to update AMI tools at the Boot Time?
AWS is recommends that your AMIs downloads and upgrade to the Amazon EC2 AMI
creation tools during the startup. This ensures that a new AMIs based on your shared AMIs
have to the
latest AMI tools.
Q246:How to update AMI tools at the Boot Time on linux?</p>
<h1 id="update-to-amazon-ec2-ami-tools">Update to Amazon EC2 AMI tools<a class="headerlink" href="#update-to-amazon-ec2-ami-tools" title="Permanent link"></a></h1>
<p>echo ” + Updating EC2 AMI tools”
yum update -y aws-amitools-ec2
echo ” + Updated EC2 AMI tools”
Q247:How does AWS Lambda to handle failure during event processing?
In AWS Lambda we can run a function of synchronous or asynchronous modes. In
synchronous mode, if AWS Lambda function is fails, then it will just give on the exception to
the calling application. In asynchronous modes, if AWS Lambda function is fails then it will
retry to the same function at least 3 times. If AWS Lambda is running in response to an
event in the Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Kinesis, then event will be retried till that
Lambda function succeeds or the data expires. In DynamoDB or Kinesis, AWS maintains
datas for at least 24 hours.
Q248:What are the Storage of classes of Amazon?
 Amazon S3
 Scalable Storage in Cloud
 Amazon EBS
 Block Storage for EC2
 AWS Elastic File System
 Managed File Storage for EC2
 Amazon Glacier
 Low-cost Achieve Storage in the
 cloud
 AWS Storage Gateway
 Hybrid Storage Integration
 Amazon Snowball
 Petabyte-Scale Data Transport
 AWS Snowball Edge
 Petabyte-scale Data to Transport with
 On-Demand Compute
 AWS Snowmobile
 Exabyte-scale Data to Transport
Q249:How do Encryption is done in S3?
 In Transit: SSL/TLS
 At Rest
 Server-Side in Encryption
 S3 Managed Keys – SSE-S3
 AWS Key Management Service, Managed of Keys – SSE-KMS
 6.Server-Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys – SSE-C
 Client-Side Encryptions
Q250:How will do upload a file greater than 100 megabytes in Amazon
S3?
Amazon S3 supports of storing objects or files up to 5 terabytes. To upload an file greater
than 100 megabytes, we have to use of Multipart upload utility from AWS. By using
Multipart upload we can upload an large file in multiple parts. Each part will be
independently to be uploaded. It doesn’t matter in what order to each part is uploaded. It
even to supports uploading these parts of parallel to decrease overall time. Once of all the
parts are uploaded, this utility makes a these as one single objects or file from which the parts
were do created.</p>
