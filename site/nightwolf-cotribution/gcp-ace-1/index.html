<p>You have a Cloud Datastore database that you would like to backup. You'd like to issue a
command and have it return immediately while the backup runs in the background. You
want the backup file to be stored in a Cloud Storage bucket named my-datastore-backup.
What command would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). gcloud datastore backup gs://my-datastore-backup
b). gsutil datastore export gs://my-datastore-backup --async
c). gcloud datastore export gs://my-datastore-backup
d). gcloud datastore export gs://my-datastore-backup --async

Correct: d

Explanation:
    The correct command is gcloud datastore export gs://my-datastore-backup --async. Export, not
    backup, is the datastore command to save data to a Cloud Storage bucket. Gsutil is used to
    manage Cloud Storage, not Cloud Datastore.

<p>Your organization has created multiple folders, one for each department. In each folder,
departments have one or more projects. What would you expect resources within the folder
to share?</p>
<pre><code>a). Service accounts
b). IAM policies
c). IAM roles
d). Permissions

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies. Service accounts are
    specific to a set of operating requirements within a project. Permissions are associated with roles
    but not directly with folders. IAM roles are granted to identities, not folders.

    Cloud SQL is a managed relational database service suitable for regionally used applications.
    Cloud Spanner is also a managed relational database but it is designed for multi-region and
    global applications. BigQuery is not used for transaction processing systems. Cloud Dataproc is
    a managed Spark/Hadoop service, not a relational database. For more information, see

<p>An auditor is reviewing your GCP use. They have asked for access to any audit logs
available in GCP. What audit logs are available for each project, folder, and organization?</p>
<pre><code>a). Admin Activity
b). User Login
c). Performance Metrics
d). System Event
e). Data Access
f). Policy Access

Correct: a, d, e

Explanation:
    Cloud Audit Logs maintain three audit logs: Admin Activity logs, Data Access logs, and System
    Event logs. There is no such thing as a Policy Access log, a User Login log, or a Performance
    Metric log in GCP Audit Logs.

<p>A developer is trying to upload files from their local device to a Compute Engine VM using
the gcloud scp command. The copy command is failing. What would you check to try to
correct the problem?</p>
<pre><code>a). Grant the identity the roles/compute.admin role
b). Add the identity of the developer to the administrator group for the VM.
c). Grant the identity compute.admin permission
d). Ensure firewall rules allow traffic to port 22 to allow SSH connections.

Correct: d

Explanation:
    To copy files to a VM, a firewall rule must be in place to allow traffic on port 22, the default
    SSH port. Administrator privileges are not needed to upload a file so the other three options are
    not correct. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/transferfiles.

<p>A group of data scientists need access to data stored in Cloud Bigtable. You want to follow
Google recommended best practices for security. What role would you assign to the data
scientist to allow them to read data from Bigtable?</p>
<pre><code>a). roles/bigtable.owner
b). roles/bigtable.reader
c). roles/bigtable.user
e). roles/bigtable.admin

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The role/bigtable.reader gives the data scientist the ability to read data but not write data or
    modify the database. This follows the Principle of Least Privilege as recommended by Google.
    Roles/bigtable.admin gives permissions to administer all instances in a project, which is not
    needed by a data scientist. Roles/bigtable.user provides read and write permissions but data
    scientist do not need read permission. There is no predefined role called roles/bigtable.owner.

c). gcloud ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://free-photos-on-gcp
d). gcloud iam ch allUsers:Viewer gs://free-photos-on-gcp

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The correct command is gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://free-photos-on-gcp. Gsutil is
    used with Cloud Storage, not gcloud so the gcloud ch option is incorrect. The term objectViewer
    is the correct way to grant read access to objects in a bucket.

Compute Engine resource would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). Autoscaler
b). Managed instance groups (MIGs)
c). Network load balancer
d). Unmanaged instance group

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Heterogeneous clusters can be run on unmanaged instance groups but not managed instance groups. 
    Network load balancer is used to distribute workload in a cluster but it is not an instance group 
    itself. Autoscaler adds and removes nodes in a managed instance group as needed.

b). Use two node pools, one configured with more CPU and memory than the other.
d). Use multiple pods with some configured for more CPU and memory.
c). Increase the number of deployments for the machine learning training process.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Node pools are used to configure resources for particular workloads. All nodes in a node pool are

want to keep costs as low as possible. They also want to minimize management overhead.
What service would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Kubernetes Engine
b). Compute Engine
c). App Engine
d). Cloud Functions

Correct: c

Explanation:
    App Engine is designed for applications written in supported languages, including Python 3, that
    need to run at low cost, and need to scale in response to rapid increases in load. App Engine is a
    managed service and as such minimizes operational overhead . Compute Engine and Kubernetes
    Engine both require more management overhead. Cloud Functions are used to respond to events
    in GCP, not to execute a continually running application.

<p>During an audit, auditors determined that there are insufficient access controls on Cloud
Storage buckets. The auditors recommend you use uniform bucket-level access. After
applying uniform bucket-level access some users that had access to objects in buckets no
longer have access. What could be the cause?</p>
<pre><code>a). Applying uniform bucket-level access removes all access privileges. No user will have access
    until permissions are reset.
b). Users do not have permissions through ACLs that allow them access to objects in buckets.
    Prior to setting uniform bucket-level access, those users had access through IAM.
c). Users do not have IAM permissions that allow them access to objects in buckets. Prior to
    setting uniform bucket-level access, those users had access through ACLs.
d). ACLs are removed when uniform bucket-level access is applied. ACLs must be recreated.

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Access is granted to Cloud Storage objects using IAM or access control lists (ACLs). When
    uniform bucket-level access is applied, users only have access through IAM roles and
    permissions. A users that could access objects before uniform bucket-level access is applied but
    not after must have had access through ACLs.

<p>A startup has an app that allows users to upload images to Cloud Storage. The images
should be analyzed as soon as possible once they are loaded. Processing takes
approximately 1 second for each image. There are periods when no images are uploaded
and other times when many images are upload in short periods of time. What compute
option would you use to process images?</p>
<pre><code>a). Compute Engine
b). Kubernetes Engine
c). App Engine Flexible
d). Cloud Functions

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Cloud Functions is used to respond to events in GCP, including uploading of files in Cloud
    Storage. Processing can finish within the time limits Cloud Functions must run. Since there are
    periods when no images are uploaded, there is no need to have an application running
    continuously and checking for new image uploads so App Engine Flexible, Cloud Engine, and
    Kubernetes Engine are more than required.

<p>The CFO of you company feels you are spending too much on BigQuery. You determine
that a few long running queries are costing more than they should. You would like to
experiment with different ways of writing these queries. You'd like to know the estimated

b). Use the --dry-run option with a bq query command.
c). Use the --estimate-cost with the gcloud command.
d). Use the Pricing Calculator.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    The correct answer is to use the --dry-run option with the bq select command. The Pricing
    Calculator can give you an estimate of aggregate costs based on storage and amount of data
    queried but it does not provide estimates of a the cost of running a specific query. There is no
    --estimate-cost option with either the bq or gcloud command.

Explanation:
    After creating a custom mode network, you will need to create subnets in regions where
    instances will be deployed. You do not have to create subnets in all regions but an instance
    cannot be deployed to a region without a subnet. Firewalls are used to control the ingress and

d). gsutil rewrite -from multiregional --to nearline gs://free-photos-gcp

Correct: a

Explanation:
    The correct command for changing the storage class is gsutil rewrite with the target storage class
    and bucket specified. Gsutil migrate is not a valid command. There is no need to specify the
    parameters -from or -to.

<p>You have created a process that will run nightly. The process needs read and write access
to two Cloud Storage buckets. You do not want to use your identity to ensure the process has
sufficient privileges. How would you ensure the process can read and write to the Cloud Storage buckets?</p>
<pre><code>a). Create a service account and grant it a role that provides read and write permission.
b). Create a federated identity and grant it permissions directly to enable read and write access.
c). Create a service account and assign permissions directly to enable read and write access.
d). Create a Cloud Identity and grant it a role that provides read and write permissions.

Correct: a

Explanation:
    Service accounts are used to provide applications and instances with an identity that can have
    roles that give the identity sufficient permission to execute operations it needs to perform.

<p>You will be running an application that requires high levels of security. You want to ensure the 
application does not run on a server that has been compromised by a rootkit or other kernel-level malware.
What kind of virtual machine would you use?</p>
<pre><code>a). Hardened VM
b). Shielded VM
c). GPU-enabled VM
d). Preemptible VM

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Shielded VMs are hardened virtual machines that use Secure Boot, virtual trusted platform
    module enabled Measured Boot, and integrity monitoring. Preemptible VMs can be taken back
    by Google at any time but cost significantly less than standard prices. Hardened VM is not a
    valid option in Compute Engine. GPU-enabled VMs can improve the performance of compute
    intensive applications, such as training machine learning models.

<p>Your company is migrating an on premises archive of files to Google Cloud. The archived files are
infrequently used but on average about once every 30 days. You would like to minimize the cost of storage.
What storage option would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Nearline Storage
b). Coldline Storage
c). Multi-regional storage
d). Persistent Disks

Correct: a

Explanation:
    Nearline Storage is a class of Cloud Storage designed for objects that will be accessed at most
    once every 30 days. Coldline Storage is suitable for objects accessed at most once per year.
    Multi-regional storage is best suited for objects that should have low latency access from
    multiple regions. Persistent disks should not be used for archival storage.

<p>You want to use Cloud Identity to create identities. You have received a verification record
for your domain. Where would you add that record?</p>
<pre><code>a). In the billing account for your organization
b). In the domain's DNS setting
c). In the metadata of each resource created in your organization
d). In IAM settings for each identity

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Cloud Identity provides domain verification records, which are added to DNS settings for the
    domain. IAM is used to control access granted to identities, it is not a place to manage domains.
    The billing account is used for payment tracking, it is not a place to manage domains. Resources
    do have metadata, but that metadata is not used to manage domains.

<p>Your company has an on premises Hadoop cluster that is to be migrated to Google Cloud.
The CFO wants to minimize operational overhead. What GCP service would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Bigtable
b). Cloud Dataproc
c). Cloud Pub/Sub
d). Cloud Dataflow

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Cloud Dataproc is a managed Spark/Hadoop service that can be used to migrate Hadoop clusters
    GCP. Cloud Pub/Sub is a queuing service that is used to ingest data and store it until it can be
    processed. Bigtable is a NoSQL database, not a queueing service. Cloud Dataflow is a stream
    and batch processing service, not a queueing service.

configurations for use with the command line interface. What command would you use to create those?</p>
<pre><code>a). gcloud config configurations create
b). gcloud config configurations set
c). gcloud configurations set
d). gcloud configurations create

Correct: a

Explanation:
    The correct command is gcloud config configurations create. Gcloud configurations crae, gcloud
    config configurations set, and gcloud configurations set are not valid gcloud commands to create
    configurations.

<p>You have deployed a sole tenant node in Compute Engine. How will this restrict what VMs run on that node.</p>
<pre><code>a). Only VMs using the same operating system will run on that node.
b). Only VMs from the same organization will run on that node.
c). Only one VM will run on that node.
d). Only VMs from the same project will run on the node.

Correct: d

Explanation:
    On a sole tenant node, only VMs from the same project will run on that node. They do not need
    to use the same operating system. Sole tenant nodes are not restricted to a single VM. VMs from
    the same organization but different projects will not run on the same sole tenant instance.

<p>You want to run a Kubernetes cluster for a high availability set of applications. What type of cluster would you use? </p>
<pre><code>a). Multi-regional
b). Single zone
c). Regional
d). Multi-zonal

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Regional clusters have replicas of the control plane while single zone and multi-zonal clusters
    have only one control plane. There is no such thing as multi-regional cluster.

<p>A large enterprise has created multiple organizations in GCP. They would like to connect
the VPC networks across organizations. What should they do?</p>
<pre><code>a). Implement a Shared VPC
b). Implement VPC Network Peering between VPCs
c). Implement a VPN between VPCs
d). Define firewall rules to allow egress traffic to other VPC networks

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Since the connected networks are in different organizations, they must use VPC Network
    Peering. VPC sharing is only available within a single organization. Firewall rule changes may
    be needed, but that is not sufficient. VPNs are used to connect GCP networks with on premises
    networks.

assign an IP address to each. What type of IP address will be assigned?</p>
<pre><code>a). Regional external address
b). Global internal address
c). Regional internal address
d). Global external address

Correct: c

Explanation:
    GCP assigns regional internal IP addresses for VM instances, including GKE pods, nodes, and
    services. They are also used for Internal TCP/UDP Load Balancing and Internal HTTP(S) Load
    Balancing.

<p>You have created a target pool with instances in two zones which are in the same region.
The target pool is not functioning correctly. What could be the cause of the problem?</p>
<pre><code>a). The target pool is not sending logs to Cloud Logging.
b). The target pool is missing a health check.
c). The target pool nodes are configured with different memory specifications
d). The target pool is not sending metrics to Cloud Monitoring.

Correct: b

Explanation:
    Target pools must have a health check to function properly. Nodes can be in different zones but
    must be in the same region. Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging are useful but they are not
    required for the target pool to function properly. Nodes in a pool have the same configuration.

<p>A manager in your company is having trouble tracking the use and cost of resources across
several projects. In particular, they do not know which resources are created by different
teams they manage. What would you suggest the manager use to help better understand which resources are used by which team?</p>
<pre><code>a). IAM policies
b). Trace logs
c). Audit logs
d). Labels

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Labels are key-value pairs attached to resources and used to manage them. The manager could
    use a key-value pair with the key 'team-name' and the value the name of the team that created the
    resource. Audit logs do not necessarily have the names of teams that own a resource. Traces are
    used for performance monitoring and analysis. IAM policies are used to control access to
    resources, not to track which team created them.

tools can be used with the migrated data warehouse. What GCP service would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Cloud SQL
b). Cloud Spanner
c). Bigtable
d). BigQuery

Correct: d

Explanation:
    BigQuery is a managed, petabyte scale data warehouse, which uses SQL. Bigtable does not
    support SQL. Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner support SQL but are designed for transaction
    processing, not analytical applications like data warehouses.

a managed service in Google Cloud. What service would you recommend?</p>
<pre><code>a). Bigtable
b). Cloud Dataflow
c). Cloud Pub/Sub
d). Cloud Dataproc

Correct: c

Explanation:
    Cloud Pub/Sub is a queuing service that is used to ingest data and store it until it can be
    processed. Bigtable is a NoSQL database, not a queueing service. Cloud Dataflow is a stream

<p>To avoid potentially violating a regulation, your company has determined that it will only
use GCP resources in North America. How would you ensure no resources are created outside of North America?</p>
<pre><code>a). Create a data lifecycle management policy that prevents data from being saved outside of North America.
b). Create an Cloud Audit policy that prevents users from creating resources outside of North America.
c). Create a policy at the folder level of the resource hierarchy that includes a constraint using a
    Resource Location Restriction.
d). Create a policy at the organization level of the resource hierarchy that includes a constraint
    using a Resource Location Restriction.

Correct: d

Explanation:
    Constraints are the standard way to restrict where resources can be created and applying policies
    with constraints will enforce those constraints for all resources in the organization. If the policy
    were applied at the folder level, it would have to be applied for all folders and that is not as
    efficient as applying at the organization level. There is no such thing as a Cloud Audit policy.
