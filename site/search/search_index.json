What are the inodes and how will you free up them? 42. How can we check the packet flow in our system? 43. what is the steal value in top command? 44. Explain what is NUMA. You may know this as \"Node Interleaving\u201d. Give an example where NUMA is beneficial, and another where it's detrimental. Hints => a). NUMA: Non Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a design where the memory is split into groups by CPU, making the memory access faster for each CPU to their memory group. b). Beneficial: Multiple processes with smaller memory footprints. Good for applications that fork processes, like Apache. Detrimental: Monolithic, memory-heavy, single processes. May be threaded, example MySQL, Redis, Java-everything, Memcached. Follow-Up Q. - what if there's only a single physical proc. 45. Customer complains that their CPUs aren't running as fast as they're rated. How would you Troubleshoot ? Hints => a). Could be heat damage - check /proc/cpuinfo for \"cpu MHz\". b). Could be the wrong CPUs installed, for that matter. Check the CPU specs in /proc/cpuinfo. OR dmidecode. c). Get 'em to tell you how to fix it (Change system profile to MaximumPerformance with omconfig, then reboot) 46. Can we check System logs on Hardware layer from OS ?How ? Hints => a). Yes, in dmesg logs or kern.log b). By using respective Hardware CLI commands. c). Specific answers hpasmcli -s \"show iml\" ==> For HP servers omreport system [alertlog | esmlog] ==> For Dell Servers 47. What can be done to improve the performance of an I/O-heavy system? Hints => a). Check RAID Level, if server using any. b). Partition aligned, i.e. starting a partition on sector 2048. c). Mount Options like: noatime - (covers norelatime/nodiratime) Can be enabled only via fstab. d). RAID Controller settings - read/write policy, e.g. write-through(good to ensure data has been changed on disk. write-back(relys on cache, battery). e). nobarrier - depends on whether or not the PERC Controller is making use of a battery or not. f). Adjust the filesystem journaling method - the default mount option is in the middle, data=ordered. This indicates the data is written out to the filesystem before the metadata in the journal is updated. The filesystem can be mounted with data=writeback which allows data to be written to the journal and disk at the same time, with the risk of some data possibly being written to the disk after the metadata that cannot be recovered after a crash. Additionally, the journal can be placed on an external device with another mount option, allowing separation of the writes to increase throughput performance for each write operation. g). discard - For SSDs. Also called fs TRIM. Extends life and improves performance of SSD drives. TRIM enables the controller to cache the expected SSD write cycles to collapse them into a \"do only once\" mechanism to prevent burning out the SSD cells, which can only be written to once with voltage. Note: For LVM, set issue_discards=1 in lvm.conf. Note: On Dell, TRIM/discard is only available on RAID controllers >= PERC H710 h). For SSD, you don't want controller caching for performance reasons. By default HPs turn caching off. Dell: Cut-through IO (CTIO) is an IO accelerator for SSD arrays that boosts the throughput of devices connected to the PERC Controller. It is enabled through disabling the write-back cache (enable writethrough cache) and disabling Read Ahead. HP: On servers with SSD drives, write caching appears to be disabled by default for performance reasons (there is no need for write caching on SSD drives which are fast enough). Writes to SSD drives will not be acknowledged until the data is actually written to disk: i). On HP, HP SSD Smart Path - this is enabled by default by the RAID creation process in the HP RAID controller itself, and can be checked with the standard commands using hpssacli to view controller details and RAID logical device details. The theory is this special method of SSD writing replaces traditional caching techniques with a special HP invented method for improving SSD performance and longevity. j). Disk IO Scheduler deadline (recommended for DBs) noop (recommended for VMs) 48. Why would I choose to use RAID-5 instead of RAID-10? Or vice versa? Hints => RAID-5: Pro: Space efficiency - you only sacrifice 1x HDD to redundancy. Pro: Possible with a minimum of 3x drives, as opposed to RAID-10's minimum-4. Con: Slow writes. Note: Reads are still quick though, so you'd be fine on a read-heavy application. Con: If two drives fail, you lose everything. RAID-10: Pro: Great performance with both reads and writes. Good for write-heavy applications. Pro: Less risk of a catastrophic failure, since more than 1 drive can fail safely (Note: Depends which drives). Con: Too much wastage of Space. Only 50% capacity is uasable. 49. How snapshots work ? Can you please explain. In terms of VMWare or LVM(in case someone asks). Hints => As soon as you create a snapshot, LVM creates a pool of blocks. This pool also contains a full copy of the LVM metadata of the volume. When writes happen to the main volume such as updating an inode, the block being overwritten is copied to this new pool and the new block is written to the main volume. This is the 'copy-on-write'. Because of this, the more data that gets changed between when a snapshot was taken and the current state of the main volume, the more space will get consumed by that snapshot pool. When you mount the snapshot, the meta-data written when the snapshot was taken allows the mapping of snapshot pool blocks over changed blocks in the volume (or higher level snapshot). This way when an access comes for a specific block, LVM knows which block access. As far as the filesystem on that volume is concerned, there are no snapshots. 50. In which scenario we need to use vgcfgrestore and vgcfgbackup commands ? When /etc/lvm/archive contents are written (when does backup happen ?) Hints => a). To restore VG configuration. b). Backup is taken whenever we make change to LVM (create/remove LV/VG) and we can use it to restore to the prior state. 51. What is default signal sent by KILL command ? Hint => a). singnal 15 (SIGTERM) is sent by default if you do not specify the signal type. Questions from Github A lot more Questions from my Github page # General Questions: 1.

RAID Controller settings - read/write policy, e.g. write-through(good to ensure data has been changed on disk. write-back(relys on cache, battery). e). nobarrier - depends on whether or not the PERC Controller is making use of a battery or not. f). Adjust the filesystem journaling method - the default mount option is in the middle, data=ordered. This indicates the data is written out to the filesystem before the metadata in the journal is updated. The filesystem can be mounted with data=writeback which allows data to be written to the journal and disk at the same time, with the risk of some data possibly being written to the disk after the metadata that cannot be recovered after a crash. Additionally, the journal can be placed on an external device with another mount option, allowing separation of the writes to increase throughput performance for each write operation. g). discard - For SSDs. Also called fs TRIM. Extends life and improves performance of SSD drives. TRIM enables the controller to cache the expected SSD write cycles to collapse them into a \"do only once\" mechanism to prevent burning out the SSD cells, which can only be written to once with voltage. Note: For LVM, set issue_discards=1 in lvm.conf. Note: On Dell, TRIM/discard is only available on RAID controllers >= PERC H710 h). For SSD, you don't want controller caching for performance reasons. By default HPs turn caching off. Dell: Cut-through IO (CTIO) is an IO accelerator for SSD arrays that boosts the throughput of devices connected to the PERC Controller. It is enabled through disabling the write-back cache (enable writethrough cache) and disabling Read Ahead. HP: On servers with SSD drives, write caching appears to be disabled by default for performance reasons (there is no need for write caching on SSD drives which are fast enough). Writes to SSD drives will not be acknowledged until the data is actually written to disk: i). On HP, HP SSD Smart Path - this is enabled by default by the RAID creation process in the HP RAID controller itself, and can be checked with the standard commands using hpssacli to view controller details and RAID logical device details. The theory is this special method of SSD writing replaces traditional caching techniques with a special HP invented method for improving SSD performance and longevity. j). Disk IO Scheduler deadline (recommended for DBs) noop (recommended for VMs) 48. Why would I choose to use RAID-5 instead of RAID-10? Or vice versa? Hints => RAID-5: Pro: Space efficiency - you only sacrifice 1x HDD to redundancy. Pro: Possible with a minimum of 3x drives, as opposed to RAID-10's minimum-4. Con: Slow writes. Note: Reads are still quick though, so you'd be fine on a read-heavy application. Con: If two drives fail, you lose everything. RAID-10: Pro: Great performance with both reads and writes. Good for write-heavy applications. Pro: Less risk of a catastrophic failure, since more than 1 drive can fail safely (Note: Depends which drives). Con: Too much wastage of Space. Only 50% capacity is uasable. 49. How snapshots work ? Can you please explain. In terms of VMWare or LVM(in case someone asks). Hints => As soon as you create a snapshot, LVM creates a pool of blocks. This pool also contains a full copy of the LVM metadata of the volume. When writes happen to the main volume such as updating an inode, the block being overwritten is copied to this new pool and the new block is written to the main volume. This is the 'copy-on-write'. Because of this, the more data that gets changed between when a snapshot was taken and the current state of the main volume, the more space will get consumed by that snapshot pool. When you mount the snapshot, the meta-data written when the snapshot was taken allows the mapping of snapshot pool blocks over changed blocks in the volume (or higher level snapshot). This way when an access comes for a specific block, LVM knows which block access. As far as the filesystem on that volume is concerned, there are no snapshots. 50. In which scenario we need to use vgcfgrestore and vgcfgbackup commands ? When /etc/lvm/archive contents are written (when does backup happen ?) Hints => a). To restore VG configuration. b). Backup is taken whenever we make change to LVM (create/remove LV/VG) and we can use it to restore to the prior state. 51. What is default signal sent by KILL command ? Hint => a). singnal 15 (SIGTERM) is sent by default if you do not specify the signal type.","title":"Linux Questions:"},{"location":"nightwolf-cotribution/linux_questionairs/#questions-from-github","text":"A lot more Questions from my Github page # General Questions: 1.
