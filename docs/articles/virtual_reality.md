* VR technology allows users to interact with the virtual environment in a realistic way, as if they were actually there.
* VR can be used for a variety of purposes, including entertainment, education, and training.

**How does VR work?**

* VR headsets use a combination of sensors and displays to create the illusion of a virtual environment.
* The sensors track the user's head movements, and the displays update the virtual environment accordingly.
* This creates a sense of immersion, as the user feels like they are actually inside the virtual world.

**Types of VR**

There are two main types of VR:

* **Head-mounted display (HMD):** This is the most common type of VR. It uses a headset that fits over the user's head and displays the virtual environment in front of their eyes.

* **Non-HMD:** This type of VR does not require a headset. Instead, it uses a computer monitor or projector to display the virtual environment.
